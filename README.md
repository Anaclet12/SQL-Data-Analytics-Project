# SQL-Data-Analytics-Project

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

# 🧠 Data Analytics Project — Continuation of *Data-Warehouse-Project*

This repository is the **second phase** of my [Data-Warehouse-Project](https://github.com/Anaclet12/data-warehouse-project) — extending the work from **data integration and modeling** to **data analysis and insight generation**.

The project demonstrates the complete analytical journey, from structured data stored in the warehouse to actionable business insights through **SQL-based exploration**, **statistical reasoning**, and **visual storytelling**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is divided into two main analytical layers:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — to understand and explore the dataset.
- **Advanced Analytics** — to uncover deeper patterns, performance insights, and business trends.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory phase focuses on **understanding the data** before applying advanced analytical techniques.

1. **Database Exploration** – discovering tables, relationships, and metadata.  
2. **Dimensions Exploration** – analyzing categorical variables such as region, product, or customer type.  
3. **Date Exploration** – studying temporal trends and seasonal effects.  
4. **Measure Exploration** – summarizing and validating quantitative indicators.  
5. **Magnitude & Ranking** – identifying top and bottom performers across dimensions.

## 📈 Advanced Analytics

After the data is cleaned, structured, and understood, this phase applies **business-driven analytical methods** to extract insights.

6. **Change-Over-Time Analysis** – trend analysis and growth patterns.  
7. **Cumulative Analysis** – progressive accumulation of key metrics.  
8. **Performance Analysis** – evaluating KPIs and comparing performance periods.  
9. **Part-to-Whole Analysis** – determining contribution ratios (e.g., product share).  
10. **Segmentation** – grouping data based on behavioral or performance patterns.  
11. **Reporting** – creating visual dashboards and summaries for business decisions.
